    "\n",
    "Now that we've looked at libraries and basic python types, it's time to start learning the power of computer science!  Basically everything we've done up until this point is just using a programming language as a _very_ fancy calculator, that is automating mathematics.  \n",
    "\n",
    "But now we'll explore the first thing we can't _really_ do with a calculator - flow of control. Flow of control centers around one basic notion - that if we can tell whether or not something is True, then we can draw conclusions from the truth of that statement.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you want to make sure, that no matter what random number you pick, it's always even.  How might you ensure that?\n",
    "\n",
    "Well, we can observe that all odd numbers are of the form: \n",
    "\n",
    "$$ 2k + 1 \\text{ s.t. } k \\in \\mathbb{N} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "If you aren't used to the above notation, the $ \\in $ stands for 'in' and the s.t. stands for 'such that'.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, knowing that all odd numbers are just an even number $+1$, we can simply add or subtract `1` to get another even number.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one more piece of syntax before we can create our code - the modulo operator: `%`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The modulo operator gets the remainder from integer division instead of the quotient.  The way this works is by observing this fact:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$m = aq + r \\text{ s.t. } m,a,q,r \\in \\mathbb{N}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "That is - for any numbers, m and a such that:\n",
    "\n",
    "$m$ is divided by $a$ we get the above formula.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at some examples to verify this:"

    "if [STATEMENT THAT RESOLVES TO TRUE OR FALSE]:\n",
    "    [SOME CODE GOES HERE]\n",
    "``` \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's talk about the statement that resolves to true or false - this is just a variable of type boolean, as we've seen in previous sections.  That is, any statement that goes into the `if` statement just needs to resolve to one of the binary values `True` or `False`.\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice there is _some_ new syntax here:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the `if` keyword - we always state any flow of control with an `if`, specifically this is saying \"if this statement is `True` then do the following.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next we have a `:` at the end of the boolean statement.  This indicates that we are about to go into what's called a new scope - that's code that may not _always_ run in every version of the program.  It's code that might only run sometimes.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, our code is indented to indicate a change in scope.  This means it goes on a new line and is either tabbed in or whitespaced in.\n",
    "\n",
    "This final point can feel very conceptual, but once you get used to reading code this way, it appears elegant and useful.\n",
    "\n",
    "Intuitively the way I think of scoping rules is as the same as a to do list.  Let's look at an example for context:\n",
    "\n",
    "Things I need to do today:\n",
    "* brush my teeth\n",
    "* study a lot\n",
    "* learn some statistics\n",
    "* eat breakfast\n",
    "* eat lunch\n",
    "* eat dinner\n",
    "    \n",
    "As you can see the above list, the individual items are _tabbed_ in, so each item is implied to be within the _scope_ of the list, things I need to do today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now let's talk about some consequences of changing scope - optionally created variables.  Best to look at an example for this:"
