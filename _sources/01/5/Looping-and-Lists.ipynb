    "In general, when programming, the main thing we are concerned about is something called efficiency.  This specifically refers to how 'fast' in general our code is.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Well the reason why programs efficiency matters, is because we are going to do things a bunch of times. And when I say a bunch of times, I some times mean trillions of times.\n",
    "\n",
    "In order to do this, we use a technique called \"iteration\". This allows us to carry out an activity many, many times.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's look at an example:"

    "The above simple example accomplishes a fairly trival task, it enumerates all the numbers between 0 and 9.  This is the basis for interation.  Iteration is _always_ indexed by the natural numbers.  That's why we name the variable we are \"iterating over\" the index.  As the index increases, we get closer and closer to the terminal statement.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here the terminal statement is inside a \"while\" loop.\n",
    "\n",
    "A while statement works somewhat like an if statement.  In an if statement, we check a condition and if the condition is True, then we execute a set of steps.  In a while loop, we check if a condition is True, the same way as before.  The difference being, we keep executing the statement, _until_ the statement is False.  This means any while loop has the potential to go on forever, without stopping.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The way we get around this generally is with something called a for loop, which will get to in a little while.\n",
