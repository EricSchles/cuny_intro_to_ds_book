    "# Decisions and Uncertainty\n",
    "We have seen several examples of assessing models that involve chance, by comparing observed data to the predictions made by the models. In all of our examples, there has been no doubt about whether the data were consistent with the model's predictions. The data were either very far away from the predictions, or very close to them.\n",
    "\n",
    "But outcomes are not always so clear cut. How far is \"far\"? Exactly what does \"close\" mean? While these questions don't have universal answers, there are guidelines and conventions that you can follow. In this section we will describe some of them.\n",

    "But first let us develop a general framework of decision making, into which all our examples will fit.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we have developed while assessing models are some of the fundamental concepts of statistical tests of hypotheses. Using statistical tests as a way of making decisions is standard in many fields and has a standard terminology. Here is the sequence of the steps in most statistical tests, along with some terminology and examples. You will see that they are consistent with the sequence of steps we have used for assessing models."

    "## Step 1: The Hypotheses\n",

    "All statistical tests attempt to choose between two views of the world. Specifically, the choice is between two views about how the data were generated. These two views are called *hypotheses*.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The null hypothesis.** This is a clearly defined model about chances. It says that the data were generated at random under clearly specified assumptions about the randomness. The word \"null\" reinforces the idea that if the data look different from what the null hypothesis predicts, the difference is due to *nothing* but chance.\n",
    "\n",
    "From a practical perspective, **the null hypothesis is a hypothesis under which you can simulate data.**\n",
    "\n",
    "In the example about Mendel's model for the colors of pea plants, the null hypothesis is that the assumptions of his model are good: each plant has a 75% chance of having purple flowers, independent of all other plants. \n",
    "\n",
    "Under this hypothesis, we were able to simulate random samples, by using `sample_proportions(929, [0.75, 0.25])`. We used a sample size of 929 because that's the number of plants Mendel grew.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The alternative hypothesis.** This says that some reason other than chance made the data differ from the predictions of the model in the null hypothesis.\n",

    "- So also if the answer is \"small values.\" \n",

    "\n",
    "In the case of the pea plants, a sample percent of around 75% will be consistent with the model, but percents much bigger or much less than 75 will make you think that the model isn't good. This indicates that the statistic should be the *distance* between the sample percent and 75, that is, the absolute value of the difference between them. Big values of the distance will make you lean towards the alternative.\n",
    "\n",

    "About 5.7% of the simulated random sample averages were 13.667 or below. If we had drawn the students of Section 3 at random from the whole class, the chance that their average would be 13.667 or lower is about 5.7%.\n",

    "This chance has an impressive name. It is called the *observed significance level* of the test. That's a mouthful, and so it is commonly called the *P-value* of the test. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Definition:** The P-value of a test is the chance, based on the model in the null hypothesis, that the test statistic will be equal to the observed value in the sample or even further in the direction that supports the alternative.**\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "When you make a conclusion in this way, we recommend that you don't just say whether or not the result is statistically significant. Along with your conclusion, provide the observed statistic and the P-value as well, so that readers can use their own judgment."

    "## Historical Note on the Conventions\n",
    "\n",
    "The determination of statistical significance, as defined above, has become standard in statistical analyses in all fields of application. When a convention is so universally followed, it is interesting to examine how it arose. \n",
    "\n",
    "The method of statistical testing – choosing between hypotheses based on data in random samples – was developed by Sir Ronald Fisher in the early 20th century. Sir Ronald might have set the convention for statistical significance somewhat unwittingly, in the following statement in his 1925 book *Statistical Methods for Research Workers*. About the 5% level, he wrote, \"It is convenient to take this point as a limit in judging whether a deviation is to be considered significant or not.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "What was \"convenient\" for Sir Ronald became a cutoff that has acquired the status of a universal constant. No matter that Sir Ronald himself made the point that the value was his personal choice from among many: in an article in 1926, he wrote, \"If one in twenty does not seem high enough odds, we may, if we prefer it draw the line at one in fifty (the 2 percent point), or one in a hundred (the 1 percent point). Personally, the author prefers to set a low standard of significance at the 5 percent point ...\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Fisher knew that \"low\" is a matter of judgment and has no unique definition. We suggest that you follow his excellent example. Provide your data, make your judgment, and explain why you made it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Whether you use a conventional cutoff or your own judgment, it is important to keep the following points in mind.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Always provide the observed value of the test statistic and the P-value, so that readers can decide whether or not they think the P-value is small.\n",
    "- Don't look to defy convention only when the conventionally derived result is not to your liking.\n",
    "- Even if a test concludes that the data don't support the chance model in the null hypothesis, it typically doesn't explain *why* the model doesn't work."
